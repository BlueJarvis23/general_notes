## Wizards Rules

- Wizard's First Rule: "People are stupid; given proper motivation, almost anyone will believe almost anything. Because people are stupid,
  they will believe a lie because they want to believe it's true, or because they're afraid it might be true. Peoples' heads are full of
  knowledge, facts and beliefs, and most of it is false, yet they think it all true. People are stupid; they can only rarely tell the
  difference between a lie and the truth, and yet they are confident they can, and so are all the easier to fool."
- Wizard's Second Rule: "The Second Rule is that the greatest harm can result from the best intentions."
- Wizard's Third Rule: "Passion rules reason."
- Wizard's Fourth Rule: "The Wizard's Fourth Rule, he called it. He said that there was magic in sincere forgiveness, in the Fourth Rule.
  Magic to heal. In forgiveness you grant, and more so in the forgiveness you receive."
- Wizard's Fifth Rule: "Mind what people do, not only what they say, for deeds will betray a lie."
- Wizard's Sixth Rule: "The most important rule there is, the Wizard's Sixth Rule: the only sovereign you can allow to rule you is reason.
  The first law of reason is this: what exists, exists, what is, is and from this irreducible bedrock principle, all knowledge is built. It
  is the foundation from which life is embraced. Thinking is a choice. Wishes and whims are not facts nor are they a means to discover them.
  Reason is our only way of grasping reality; it is our basic tool of survival. We are free to evade the effort of thinking, to reject reason,
  but we are not free to avoid the penalty of the abyss that we refuse to see. Faith and feelings are the darkness to reason's light. In
  rejecting reason, refusing to think, one embraces death."
- Wizard's Seventh Rule: "Life is the future, not the past. The past can teach us, through experience, how to accomplish things in the
  future, comfort us with cherished memories, and provide the foundation of what has already been accomplished. But only the future holds
  life. To live in the past is to embrace what is dead. To live life to its fullest, each day must be created anew. As rational, thinking
  beings, we must use our intellect, not a blind devotion to what has come before, to make rational choices."
- Wizard's Eighth Rule: "Talga Vassternich. Deserve Victory."
- Wizard's Ninth Rule: "A contradiction can not exist in reality. Not in part, nor in whole. To believe in a contradiction is to abdicate
  your belief in the existence of the world around you and the nature of the things in it, to instead embrace any random impulse that
  strikes your fancy - to imagine something is real simply because you wish it were. A thing is what it is, it is itself. There can be no
  contradictions. Faith is a device of self-delusion, a sleight of hand done with words and emotions founded on any irrational notion that can
  be dreamed up. Faith is the attempt to coerce truth to surrender to whim. In simple terms, it is trying to breath life into a lie by trying
  to outshine reality with the beauty of wishes. Faith is the refuge of fools, the ignorant, and the deluded, not of thinking, rational men.
  In reality, contradictions cannot exist. To believe in them you must abandon the most important thing you possess: your rational mind. The
  wager for such a bargain is your life. In such an exchange, you always lose what you have at stake."
- Wizard's Tenth Rule: "Willfully turning aside from the truth is treason to one's self."
- Wizard's Eleventh Rule: "The rule of all rules. The rule unwritten. The rule unspoken since the dawn of history... But Barracus wanted you
  to know that it's the secret to using a war wizard's power. The only way to express it, to make sure that you would grasp what he was
  intending to tell you, was to give you a book unwritten to signify the rule unwritten."
